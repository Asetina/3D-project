The project is dedicated to the development of a computer program designed to automate typical tasks encountered in 3D printing laboratories in preparation for the production of products from electronic drawings provided by customers.\
Developed features:
	- Reading files in binary and text format STL.
	- Checking for geometric errors in the file.
	- Counting model volume.
	- Generation of a control program for a 3D printer.
	- Calculation of the duration of printing.
